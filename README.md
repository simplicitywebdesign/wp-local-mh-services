# wp-local-mh-services
A WordPress plugin to display local mental health services information.

This plugin adds (through shortcodes, php template tags and/or widgets) a front-end interface whereby visitors to a site can see/access information regarding their local mental health support services in their region. Particularly useful for appending to articles discussing difficult topics such as suicide, sexual assault, domestic violence, etc.

If access to location is provided by the user, they will see their local service, if not provided, a dropdown allowing them to filter a master list.
